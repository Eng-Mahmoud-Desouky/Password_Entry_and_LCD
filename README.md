# Password_Entry_and_LCD
## Description
This project leverages a Keypad and an LCD screen in conjunction with an Arduino board to create a system that allows the user to input a specific password. When the correct password is entered on the keypad, it is successfully displayed on the LCD. In case an incorrect password is entered, an error message is displayed on the screen.

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino Board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Arduino Nano)
- 4x4 Matrix Keypad
- Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) with I2C interface (e.g., 16x2 or 20x4)
- Jumper wires for connections
- Breadboard (optional, for prototyping)
- Power supply for the Arduino (USB or external power source)
- Resistors (usually required for keypad connections)
- This title adheres to the repository name restrictions on GitHub.
